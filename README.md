# Todo_App

This TODO APP is divided into a database (SQL), a server (NodeJS) and a mobile App (React Native).

By using React Native, we can create applications for both iOS and Android with the same code.

The server can be implemented with many technologies, but in our case, we are going to use NodeJS with ExpressJS to create our API.

Finally, we will use a relational SQL database because this application, being simple, will make development much easier.

To start the server section:

`cd ./server`
`yarn dev`

To start the client section

`cd ./client`
`npx expo start`
